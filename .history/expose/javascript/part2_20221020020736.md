Question 1:     It would print out prices.length, which is 3
Question 2:     It would print out the last updated value of discountedPrice, which is 150
Question 3:     It would print out the last updated value of finalPrice, which is 150
Question 4:     Nothing will be printed as it is commented out, however, the function will return the array[50, 100, 150]
Question 5:     Error, which is caused by i not being defined as it is being referenced to outside of its code block
Question 6:     Error, which is caused by discountedPrice not being defined as it is being referenced to outside of its code block
Question 7:     150
Question 8:     Nothing will be printed as it is commented out, however, the function will return the array[50, 100, 150]
Question 9:     Error, which is caused by i not being defined as it is being referenced to outside of its code block
Question 10:    3
Question 11:    Nothing will be printed as it is commented out, however, the function will return the array[50, 100, 150] as though const variables can't be modified, values can still be pushed in
Question 12:   
                A:  student.name
                B:  student['Grad Year']
                C:  student.greeting()
                D:  student['Favorite Teacher'].name
                E:  student.courseLoad[0]
Question 13:    
                A: '32', as 2 is cast to a string
                B: 1, as 3 is cast to a number
                C: 3, as null is cast to 0
                D: '3null', as null is cast to string 'null'
                E: 4, as true is evaluated as 1
                F: 0, as false is evaluated to 0 and null is evaluated to 0
                G: '3undefined', as undefined is cast to a string
                H: NaN, as undefined is not a valid number and can't be cast to a number
Question 14:
                A: True, '2' is cast to number 2, which is greater than 1
                B: False, the first character of '2', '2' is after '12''s first character, '1'
                C: True, '2' can be cast to 2
                D: False, they are not equivalent as they are not of the same type
                E: False, true evaluates to 1, which is not 2
                F: True, as Boolean() of a number larger than 0 is true, which is the same
Question 15:    == just checks the data value of the compared variables, === also make sure the data type of the variables are the same
