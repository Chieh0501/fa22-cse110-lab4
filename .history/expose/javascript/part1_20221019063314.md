Var:    values added:  20  
        final result:  20
        *Works as a pseudo-global variable as in other programming languages*

Const:  Error, assignment to const variables
        *const variables are not supposed to be modified*

Let:    values added:  20
        final result: error, result is not defined
        *This occurs because let only defines the variable in the scope of the block*
